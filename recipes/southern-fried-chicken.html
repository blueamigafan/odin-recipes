    <p>A classic southern fried chicken recipe the sort of which has been handed down through the generations</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <l1>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces</l1>
    <br><l1>2 eggs, beaten</l1>
    <br><l1>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</l1>
    <br><l1>2 teaspoons salt</l1>
    <br><l1>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</l1>
    <br><l1>2 teaspoons garlic powder</l1>
    <br><l1>2 teaspoons onion powder</l1>
    <br><l1>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</l1>
    <br><l1>1 ½ cups vegetable oil for frying</l1>
</ul>   
    <h1>Method</h1>
<ol>
<li>In a medium size bowl mix together the eggs and milk. Add ALMOST all of the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder (reserve a dash of each for seasoning the chicken pieces). Set aside.</li>

<br><li>Sprinkle a dash of the remaining salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder onto both sides of the chicken pieces.</li>

<br><li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Put the flour in a plastic bag. One piece at a time, dip the chicken into the egg/milk mixture then add to the plastic bag. Shake the bag so that the flour is covering each piece of chicken.</li>

<br><li>You can check to see if the oil is hot enough by sprinkling a little flour in the skillet. If it fries, it's hot enough! Place the chicken pieces in the skillet. After about 5 minutes, turn the chicken over. Let chicken fry for about 15 minutes or until the meat is cooked through and the juices run clear. Enjoy!</li>

    <h1>Chicken Tikka Masala</h1>
    <img src="chicken-tikka-masala.jpeg" alt="chicken tikka masala" width="750" height ="600">
    <p>A classic curry-stand recipe. This is not haute cuisine; 
        this is the kind of nuclear-orange tikka masala that you 
        crave when you stumble out of a pub at 2 a.m. I make vast 
        quantities of the sauce at one time, and it freezes very 
        well. I also added much more cayenne pepper than 1 teaspoon, 
        but I give out the recipe like this for people who don't like 
        heat.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <l1>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</l1>
    <br><l1>1 onion, finely chopped</l1>
    <br><l1>4 cloves garlic, minced</l1>
    <br><l1>1 tablespoon ground cumin</l1>
    <br><l1>1 teaspoon salt (Optional)</l1>
    <br><l1>1 teaspoon ground ginger</l1>
    <br><l1>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</l1>
    <br><l1>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</l1>
    <br><l1>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</l1>
    <br><l1>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</l1>
    <br><l1>1 cup heavy whipping cream</l1>
    <br><l1>2 teaspoons paprika</l1>
    <br><l1>1 tablespoon white sugar (Optional)</l1>
    <br><l1>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</l1>
    <br><l1>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces</l1>
    <br><l1>½ teaspoon curry powder</l1>
    <br><l1>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste (Optional)</l1>
    <br><l1>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste (Optional)</l1>
</ul>   
    <h1>Method</h1>
<ol>
<li>Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric into the onion mixture; fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>

<br><li>Stir tomato sauce into the onion and spice mixture, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce for 10 minutes, then mix in cream, paprika, and 1 tablespoon sugar. Bring sauce back to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>

<br><li>Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir chicken into the hot oil, sprinkle with curry powder, and sear chicken until lightly browned but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often. Transfer chicken and any pan juices into the sauce. Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink, about 30 minutes; adjust salt and sugar to taste.</li>
